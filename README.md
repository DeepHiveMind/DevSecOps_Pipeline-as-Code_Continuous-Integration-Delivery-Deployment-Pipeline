# CI Integration vs CD Delivery vs CD Deployment

* CI == continuous integration, 
    - a practice that focuses on making preparing a release easier. 
    
* CD == either Continuous DELIVERY or Continuous DEPLOYMENT, 
     - while those two practices have a lot in common, they also have a significant difference that can have critical consequences for a business.
