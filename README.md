This repo details out nunaces of following aspects with relevant codesets:
- DevSecOps | Pipeline-as-Code | 
- Continuous-Integration --> Continuous-Delivery ---> Continuous- Deployment 
- Overview of A Fully Automated DevSecOps CI CD Pipeline
- Automated DevSecOps CI CD Pipeline hosted at AWS (DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins Multi-branch Pipelines hosted **at AWS** with **codeset**)
- DevOps CD Pipeline for AI/ML hosted at Azure (**DevOps in ML** -MLOPS Continuous Deployment flow **at Azure** based on DOCKER, KUBERNETES, HELM, KUBEFLOW, TESNORFLOW, TF-SERVING  with **codeset**)


# A Quick Rundown

# CI Integration vs CD Delivery vs CD Deployment

* CI == continuous integration, 
    - a practice that focuses on making preparing a release easier. 
    
* CD == either Continuous DELIVERY or Continuous DEPLOYMENT, 
     - while those two practices have a lot in common, they also have a significant difference that can have critical consequences for a business.
